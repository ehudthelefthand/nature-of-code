# Learning The Nature of Code
This repo dedicated for learning the Processing topic which I took the course from **[The Nature of Code](https://vimeo.com/channels/natureofcode)**.

Go check that out if you interesting in Processing and by the way Shiffman is really cool teacher!

**Note:** *Instead of learning it by using Processing app. I rather use JavaScript as my brush to paint my imagination.*
